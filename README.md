# Predicting the mood of depression patients

Repository for the Data Mining Techniques assignment (VU University Amsterdam, April 2017)

The project tries to predict the average mood of depression patients, on the following day from the current data. It uses a dataset from a mobile phone application tailored for this purpose.

The scripts are divided in preprocessing and regression models (SVM and RF). Other scripts made for this project are not available in GitHub.
